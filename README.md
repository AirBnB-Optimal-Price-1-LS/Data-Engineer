# Data Science Repo for AirBnB Optimal Price Predictor

The Data Science team for this project had two focuses, described below:<br>

## Data Engineering

Building and deploying a Flask API app to communicate price predictions to the back-end of the web app. Brainstorming with the back-end engineers, we settled on transmitting requests between their back-end server and our API via JSON object. This approach allowed our python-specific research and modeling to be ingested by their back-end servers and for us to unpack any requests coming through our API to be unpacked and read through our model using python.<br>

In addition to the repo, The API is also located [here](https://airbnb-prediction-api.herokuapp.com/)

## Machine Learning

TODO - add machine learning description and link to notebooks.
